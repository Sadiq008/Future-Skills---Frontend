1. How can you implement shared functionality across a component tree?
--> By using Context API because It allows you to share state across the entire component tree without manually passing props down at every level.

2. Why is the `useState` hook appropriate for handling state in a complex component?
--> The useState hook is appropriate for handling state in a complex component because it allows you to manage individual pieces of state in a functional and predictable way, without needing to manage state in a class component. It simplifies state management by letting you declare multiple state variables directly in the component where they are used.

3. Design a user interface resembling the provided page. Fetch the data from the server and dynamically map the information cards to the fetched data. Ensure that the search functionality is also implemented.
